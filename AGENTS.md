# Agent Playbook (Living Document)

This file is the authoritative reference for platform architecture and agent
expectations. It must always describe the current, production-ready state of the
system—never legacy behavior. Update this file alongside any material feature
change. Only capture structural, user-visible, or integration-impacting details;
omit trivia. When we remove/replace something, like a feature, I DO NOT want you
to document the removal or replacement here, but instead, if that feature is
documented here currently, I want you to just remove it if we done removal and
replace it with teh new feature if we did replacement. The reason is that I only
want to support latest versions of my application here without documenting the
previous iterations, this file should serve as the current machination
explanation of my codebase and not for changelogs. If any previous version
explanation is present here, then it should be removed. Do not also imply that
we just implemented a certain feature here, by using words like "we now have
this X feature" since I only want to imply that the features we have iin our
application was in here already initially, without any implications of the new
changes we made.

## Documentation Expectations

- Update this document whenever routes, flows, data contracts, or integration
  requirements change.
- Describe the latest behavior succinctly; avoid references to prior
  implementations.
- Skip minor cosmetic tweaks—limit entries to structural or behavioral updates
  that affect future engineering work.

## Engineering Principles

1. **Import cleanly, delete legacy.** Never add re‑exports or preserve legacy
   APIs. Always import from canonical sources and remove unused branches, empty
   blocks, or deprecated files during every change.

2. **Extend before you create.** Before writing new functions, components, or
   libraries, analyze existing ones in `src/lib`, shared UI, and feature
   modules. Check related files for possible extension points—props, return
   types, or configuration options. Prefer enhancing them by adding parameters
   or return variants rather than duplicating logic. Only build something new
   when there’s _no existing code_ that can be extended without harm.

3. **Simplify through reuse.** If you or the AI analysis discover that a piece
   of code can be simplified by calling an existing component, function, or
   library instead of re‑implementing logic, refactor it. Merge redundant
   utilities or components when their behavior overlaps and eliminate
   unnecessary abstractions. The codebase should always converge toward fewer,
   more capable building blocks.

4. **Be minimal and accessible.** All new pages and components should follow the
   modern, minimal UI style—clean, responsive, and accessible (ARIA labels,
   focus states, keyboard navigation, color contrast). Avoid over‑engineering or
   speculative flexibility.

5. **Type‑sound and consistent.** Run `pnpm typecheck` before merging. Maintain
   consistent naming, small API surfaces, and clear defaults. Remove unused
   files and ensure new or extended helpers live in canonical locations to
   encourage immediate reuse.

### Examples

- Instead of creating `formatDate2`, extend `formatDate` with
  `options: { locale?: string; format?: string }`.
- Replace custom loaders with an existing `Spinner` component configured via
  props rather than duplicating markup.
- If two button variants differ only in color and spacing, merge them into one
  component with configurable variants.
- When adding a new fetch utility, inspect existing APIs—if a related
  `fetchData` exists, add optional parameters or expand return types instead of
  building another function.

### Guiding Mindset

Analyze → Extend → Simplify → Delete. Every change should either improve
clarity, reduce duplication, or enable reuse. Only create new code when
absolutely necessary and back it with clear reasoning in the PR description.

# Next.js 15 App Router Project Structure Guide

You are an AI coding assistant that builds **production-grade, scalable Next.js
15 App Router** applications.

When creating or editing a project, assume this blueprint as the default unless
explicitly told otherwise:

- Use **Next.js 15** with the **App Router** under `src/app`.
- Use **TypeScript** everywhere (`.ts`, `.tsx`).
- Use a **`src/`-based layout**: application code under `src`, configuration at
  the project root.
- Treat components in `app/` as **Server Components by default**; add
  `"use client"` only when necessary.
- Use **`middleware.ts`** at `src/middleware.ts` to run logic before a request
  is completed (auth, redirects, rewrites, logging).
- Manage environment variables with **workspace-scoped `.env` files**:
  - Root `.env.local` / `.env.*` for the Next.js app and cross-cutting services.
  - `blockchain/.env` for Hardhat deployment secrets, with
    `blockchain/.env.example` as a template.
- Use **Convex** as the off-chain backend stack.
- Support a **Hardhat blockchain workspace** under `blockchain/` with a Mezo
  Testnet `SubscriptionManager.sol` as the canonical Solidity contract and
  frontend subscription helpers in `src/lib/contracts/`.
- Keep **caching explicit** in Next.js 15:
  - `GET` Route Handlers are **not cached by default**.
  - `fetch` is **`no-store` by default** in many server contexts.
  - Opt into caching via route segment config (`dynamic`, `revalidate`, etc.)
    and `fetch` options.
  - Centralize caching decisions in a small number of modules instead of
    scattering them.

Everything below defines **where to place each file**, **what belongs in each
folder**, and **how to avoid redundant files**.

## 2. Placement Rules for New Files and Folders

When adding or modifying code, follow these steps.

### 2.1 Determine the correct layer

1. **Route UI**  
   → `src/app/**`
2. **Shared UI** (reused across routes/features)  
   → `src/components/**`
3. **Feature-specific UI or domain logic**  
   → `src/features/<feature>/**`
4. **Hook**
   - Feature-specific → `src/features/<feature>/hooks`
   - Cross-cutting → `src/hooks`
5. **Data access / env / caching / auth / contracts / utilities**
   - Cross-cutting infra → `src/lib/**`
   - Domain workflow → `src/features/<feature>/services`
6. **Vendor service client** (payments, email, analytics)  
   → `src/services/**`
7. **Global app state**  
   → `src/state/**` (only if truly global)
8. **Smart-contract code/tooling**
   - Solidity contracts → `blockchain/contracts`
   - Hardhat config and deployment scripts → `blockchain/**`
   - Frontend ABIs/addresses/clients → `src/lib/contracts/**`
9. **Environment configuration**
   - Next.js app + services → root `.env.*` + `src/lib/env/**`
   - Blockchain tooling → `blockchain/.env` (template:
     `blockchain/.env.example`)

### 2.2 Prefer extending existing modules over creating new ones

Before creating a new helper or service file:

1. Search existing modules:
   - `src/lib/utils`
   - `src/lib/api`
   - `src/lib/env`
   - `src/lib/db`
   - `src/lib/contracts`
   - `src/features/<feature>/services`
2. If similar behavior exists:
   - Extend the existing module:
     - Add a new function or overload.
     - Add options/parameters.
     - Add code paths that preserve existing behavior by default.
3. Only create new files when:
   - Responsibility is clearly distinct.
   - Extending existing modules would reduce clarity.

### 2.3 Server vs client boundaries

- Do **not** import:
  - `src/lib/db/**`,
  - `src/lib/env/**`,
  - `blockchain/**`  
    in client-only components or hooks.
- Client components may:
  - Call server actions in `src/lib/api`.
  - Use contract clients designed for the browser.
- Secrets, DB access, and low-level contract deployment logic must stay in:
  - Server Components.
  - Route handlers.
  - Server actions.
  - Scripts.
  - Feature services invoked from server contexts.

### 2.4 Routing-specific decisions

- Use route groups `(marketing)`, `(app)`, `(auth)` to organize sections.
- Use dynamic segments `[id]` for resource-specific pages.
- Introduce additional route groups as needed (`(admin)`, `(studio)`, etc.).
- Keep URLs stable; refactor internals via groups and feature refactors rather
  than URL churn.

### 2.5 Caching and performance (Next.js 15)

- Centralize expensive logic in:
  - `src/lib/cache`, `src/lib/db`, or feature services.
- Remember:
  - `GET` Route Handlers are uncached by default.
  - `fetch` defaults to no-store in many server scenarios.
- Opt into caching explicitly using:
  - Route config (`dynamic`, `revalidate`).
  - `fetch` options.
- Avoid copy-pasting caching logic; prefer shared helpers.

### 2.6 Database and services

- Convex schema and functions live under `convex/`.
- Convex client helpers live under `src/lib/db/convex/client.ts`.
- Domain-specific data workflows belong in feature services or Convex functions.

### 2.7 Blockchain workspace (if present)

- Keep all Solidity in `blockchain/contracts`.
- Use Hardhat scripts to compile/deploy `SubscriptionManager.sol`.
- Keep frontend subscription address and price env values in root `.env.local`.
- Never import from `blockchain/**` in the Next.js runtime; rely on
  `src/lib/contracts/**`.

**KEEP THE HEADINGS CONTENTS BELOW UPDATED:**

## API endpoints

- `POST /api/auth` and `DELETE /api/auth` — create or clear the wallet session
  cookies used by protected app routes and return the connected wallet's Convex
  user profile when available; successful browser wallet connections redirect
  public-page users to `/dashboard` after the session is synced.
- `GET /api/health` — returns Tollora readiness checks for Mezo, x402, wallet
  onboarding, external API forwarding, marketplace listings, and receipts.
- `POST /api/webhooks` — records inbound webhook events to Convex with source,
  event type, sanitized headers, raw payload text, and parsed JSON payload when
  available.
- `GET /api/settings/profile` and `PUT /api/settings/profile` — read and
  persist wallet-scoped creator profile settings in the Convex `users` table,
  enforce unique usernames across saved profiles, and return profile validation
  errors for onboarding and settings pages.
- `GET /api/admin/access` — verifies that the active browser wallet matches the
  wallet session cookie and an allowlisted admin address before the header
  renders the admin shortcut.
- `POST /api/admin/users/bulk-delete` — allows admin wallets to delete selected
  user directory rows through the shared server-fed table bulk action contract.
- `POST /api/admin/products/bulk-delete` — allows admin wallets to delete
  selected provider-created products through the shared server-fed table; static
  Tollora public data products are not removed by this endpoint.
- `POST /api/admin/orders/bulk-delete` — allows admin wallets to delete
  selected marketplace order records from the persisted admin ledger.
- `POST /api/providers/self/products` — validates provider API product input,
  schema JSON, wallet fields, upstream endpoint URL, upstream auth, async
  polling mappings, runtime model, price, agent readiness, and visibility, then
  records a provider-created marketplace listing and returns the accepted
  product response.
- `PATCH /api/providers/self/products/[slug]/status` — updates an
  owner-matched provider product lifecycle state between draft, published, and
  paused for management workflows.
- `DELETE /api/providers/self/products/[slug]` — deletes a provider-created API
  product owned by the connected wallet from the local provider catalog and
  removes it from provider management and marketplace discovery.
- `POST /api/providers/self/products/bulk-delete` — deletes selected
  provider-created API products owned by the connected wallet from the local
  provider catalog; default admin-owned products are ignored by the product
  store.
- `POST /api/orders` — validates a buyer API request payload and returns a
  payment-required order record for the selected marketplace product.
- `GET /api/orders/[orderId]` — returns an order lifecycle record.
- `GET /api/orders/[orderId]/provider-status` — polls a provider adapter for
  long-running job status, compares final credit-metered usage with the prepaid
  quote, locks results that require a metered delta, and returns the latest
  provider payload.
- `GET /api/receipts/[receiptId]` — returns a MUSD settlement receipt record.
- `POST /api/credits/accounts` — creates or returns a managed credit account and
  Tollora API key for a wallet.
- `POST /api/credits/top-ups` — records a MUSD top-up transaction hash and
  increases the wallet's managed credit balance.
- `POST /api/credits/products/[slug]/call` — calls a product with a Tollora API
  key, reserves managed credits before provider work starts, releases the
  reservation on provider failure, settles lower final usage back to the credit
  balance, and records a receipt linked to the top-up transaction.
- `GET /api/agents/runs` and `POST /api/agents/runs` — list and create
  autonomous agent runs with optional template ID, objective, source context,
  owner wallet, budget cap, max paid actions, and tool selection mode. AI
  selection resolves the current agent-ready catalog server-side; manual
  selection accepts an explicit bounded tool slug list.
- `GET /api/agents/runs/[runId]` — returns agent run status, paid actions,
  deliverables, receipts, and proof state.
- `DELETE /api/agents/runs/[runId]` — stops future execution for an autonomous
  agent run, removes it from the workspace run list, and attempts to cancel and
  refund unused vault budget when applicable.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/bulk-delete` — deletes selected agent runs from the
  current server-side run store and attempts the same stop/refund behavior as
  single-run deletion for each selected row.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/funding/prepare` — prepares a production
  agent run vault funding payload with run ID, MUSD token, vault address,
  budget amount, authorized agent signer, and expiry.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/funding/confirm` — records the wallet funding
  and approval transactions for a production agent run budget.
- `GET /api/agents/runs/[runId]/ledger` — returns the agent budget ledger
  events for funding, spend, refunds, and proof context.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/refund` — records or submits unused budget
  refund state after a production run reaches a terminal state.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/execute` — runs the autonomous workflow,
  calling selected Tollora x402 product endpoints with the configured funded
  production agent spender, using the current app origin for hosted x402 calls,
  preparing the agent signer's MUSD Permit2 allowance when required, and
  returning detailed payment or provider failures for action diagnostics.
- `POST /api/agents/runs/[runId]/attest` — hashes completed run metadata and
  writes the proof to the configured Mezo AgentRunAttestor when available.
- `GET /api/proofs/[proofId]` — returns a public proof package for a completed
  autonomous agent run.
- `GET /api/x402/products/[slug]/call` and `POST /api/x402/products/[slug]/call`
  — protect product calls with x402, return HTTP 402 payment requirements for
  unpaid requests, quote credit-metered requests before payment, verify and
  settle signed MUSD payments through the configured facilitator, start
  credit-metered async provider work only after settlement, return paid provider
  responses or pollable job records, and attach receipt metadata.
- `POST /api/x402/orders/[orderId]/claim` — protects metered result release with
  x402 when final provider usage exceeds the prepaid quote, settles the delta in
  MUSD, unlocks the stored provider result, and records a delta receipt.
- `POST /api/providers/openapi/preview` — imports a hosted or uploaded OpenAPI
  JSON/YAML document and returns paid-listing candidates with inferred endpoint
  URL, method, auth type, schemas, reference payload, async polling paths, and
  result mapping.
- `GET /api/openapi.json` — returns the Tollora OpenAPI document.
- `GET /api/reference` — serves the Scalar API reference for the OpenAPI
  document.

## Architecture Overview

- Next.js 15 App Router under `src/app` with `(marketing)` and `(app)` route
  groups.
- Convex backend in `convex/` with marketplace tables for users, providers,
  API products, product versions, orders, receipts, API requests, webhook events,
  usage events, payouts, autonomous agent runs, agent actions, agent proofs,
  saved examples, and reviews; client helper in
  `src/lib/db/convex/client.ts`.
- Hardhat blockchain workspace in `blockchain/` with
  `contracts/SubscriptionManager.sol` plus `contracts/AgentRunAttestor.sol` for
  Mezo proof hashes and `contracts/ApiPaymentEscrow.sol` for prepaid
  credit-metered API payments plus `contracts/AgentRunVault.sol` for
  user-funded autonomous agent budgets. The agent attestor deploy script prints
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ATTESTOR_ADDRESS` for the root app environment; the API
  escrow deploy script prints `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PAYMENT_ESCROW_ADDRESS`; the
  agent vault deploy script prints `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_RUN_VAULT_ADDRESS`.
- Shared UI primitives in `src/components/ui` and layout shells in
  `src/components/layout`.
- Shared JSON rendering lives in `src/components/data-display/json-viewer.tsx`
  with default copy support, collapsible diagnostics, and nested JSON string
  normalization for provider responses, request previews, agent deliverables,
  and public proof payloads.
- Shared server-fed table rendering lives in
  `src/components/data-display/server-data-table.tsx` with URL-driven search,
  sorting, pagination, optional current-page row selection, and optional bulk
  actions. Sortable headers use a shared icon-led sort button that shows
  unsorted, ascending, and descending states. Selectable tables render a master
  checkbox in the first header column for selecting all rows on the current
  server-paginated page, plus a compact bulk-action toolbar above the table.
  Table search, sort, pagination, and filter controls update the URL with
  client-side router pushes that preserve scroll position so server-fed table
  interactions feel local instead of page-jumping. Pages with multiple
  independent tables use prefixed query parameters so each table can be
  searched, sorted, and paginated without resetting neighboring tables.
  Selection is enabled only for tables that need row-level or bulk operations,
  and the shared selection controller supports current-page master selection
  plus controlled selection state for custom workflows.
  Server-side query helpers live in `src/lib/table/server-table.ts` and are
  used by agent templates/runs, marketplace products, orders, and provider
  product management.
- Shared site header in `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx` across marketing
  and app shells, with Tollora logo branding, public navigation, theme controls,
  a server-verified admin shortcut for allowlisted active wallets, and an
  avatar account menu. The account menu shows wallet-scoped profile identity and
  dashboard/profile/settings shortcuts only when a wallet is connected, and
  keeps the active RainbowKit wallet control available without occupying
  persistent header space. Connected wallets must complete the profile
  onboarding overlay with a full name, unique username, and email before
  continuing through the app; the overlay stays open while users type and
  closes only after the completed profile is saved. The onboarding overlay
  embeds the active RainbowKit wallet control so users can disconnect a wrong
  wallet before creating a profile. Profile data powers creator identity
  displays on marketplace, provider, receipt, and agent surfaces. Creator
  profile settings persist through `/api/settings/profile` into the Convex
  `users` table and hydrate client displays through
  `src/hooks/use-user-settings.ts`; browser localStorage is not used for profile
  persistence.
- The app favicon is generated from the Tollora logo and lives only at
  `src/app/favicon.ico`; public image branding lives at
  `public/images/tollora-logo.png`.
- Authenticated app routes use compact icon-led sidebars in
  `src/components/layout/app-sidebar.tsx` and
  `src/components/layout/admin-sidebar.tsx` for workspace and admin navigation.
- Tollora marketplace product registry, provider-created listings, product
  schemas, upstream auth metadata, async polling mappings, prices, x402 flags,
  and dashboard metrics live in `src/features/marketplace/products.ts`; reusable
  marketplace cards live in `src/features/marketplace/product-card.tsx`.
  Subscription plan metadata and tier fee splits live in
  `src/lib/contracts/subscription.ts`: Free providers keep 95%, Base providers
  keep 97%, and Plus providers keep 99% of successful paid calls.
  Marketplace orders persist to `.tollora/marketplace-orders.json`, settlement
  receipts persist to `.tollora/settlement-receipts.json`, managed credit
  accounts persist to `.tollora/managed-credit-accounts.json`, and provider
  call counts, success rates, gross volume, platform fees, and earnings are
  derived from those order and receipt ledgers instead of static product
  counters.
  Receipt builders resolve the provider profile plan through
  `src/features/marketplace/provider-fees.ts`, default to Free when no saved
  plan exists, and store the provider plan, platform fee bps, provider share
  bps, platform fee amount, and provider amount on successful receipts.
  Tollora Labs public data wrappers for Wikipedia search, Hacker News trend
  search, GitHub repository search, npm package search, OpenAlex research
  search, and GDELT news search use no upstream account or API key, stay
  x402-protected as paid Tollora marketplace products, are owned by the
  allowlisted admin provider wallet, and are agent-ready for no-key public-data
  runs.
  Marketplace and product pages show the creator identity card with avatar,
  name, username, and wallet address for these products and provider-created
  listings. These products
  execute through the dedicated
  `src/features/provider-adapters/public-data/adapter.ts` adapter, which
  normalizes provider-specific request parameters, applies bounded upstream
  timeouts, and uses no-key public fallback sources for providers that rate
  limit, reject narrow queries, or return temporary gateway errors.
  Provider-created listings are persisted to the workspace-local
  `.tollora/provider-products.json` catalog so draft, paused, and published
  products remain manageable across local server restarts. Provider dashboards
  and provider product management filter by product `ownerWallet`, while payout
  settlement continues to use `providerWallet`; this keeps listing management
  separate from the wallet that receives provider earnings.
- Autonomous agent templates, OpenAI planning and synthesis, deterministic
  fallback planning, run storage, funded budget ledgers, paid action execution,
  proof hashing, status labels, and UI clients live in `src/features/agents`.
  Agent runs and proof records persist to `.tollora/agent-runs.json` and
  `.tollora/agent-proofs.json` so recent runs, statuses, funding ledgers,
  paid-action diagnostics, receipts, and proofs remain visible across local
  server restarts.
  Template definitions live in `src/features/agents/templates.ts` and include
  reusable objectives, context, budgets, action limits, tool strategy, and
  deliverables for launch, research, documentation, readiness, and creative
  workflows, including video-first launch campaigns that combine public data
  scans with async media-generation tools when budget allows. Agent runs
  require the owner to fund the
  `AgentRunVault` with MUSD before the configured agent signer can execute x402
  paid actions. Before an agent spends, the runner verifies the production
  agent signer's MUSD balance, submits the required Permit2 approval when the
  allowance is insufficient, waits until the allowance is readable, and then
  executes the hosted x402 call from the same origin that triggered the run.
  Paid action failures preserve the response body, settlement guidance, and
  provider details in action diagnostics. Agent-paid x402 calls include the
  agent run ID in gateway order and receipt records so provider dashboards and
  usage pages count autonomous tool calls in the same revenue ledger as browser
  and developer API calls. When
  `AGENT_LLM_API_KEY` is configured, the agent uses the OpenAI Responses API
  with `AGENT_LLM_MODEL` or `gpt-5.2` to select tools, generate request
  payloads, skip unrelated tools, set a budget strategy, and synthesize the
  final launch pack from completed paid responses and receipts. When no paid
  action completes in production, the run remains failed and presents
  diagnostics instead of treating generated copy as verified output. When the
  key is absent, the deterministic fallback ranks the allowed marketplace tools
  from the objective and source context. Both planner modes record the prompt,
  model or fallback label, rationale, skipped tools, selected tools, funding
  ledger, and synthesis metadata in run deliverables, action cards, and proof
  payloads.
- `/agents` is a tabbed command center that opens on recent runs and also
  exposes a templates tab. Both tabs use separate server-fed tables with
  search, sorting, and pagination; recent runs support current-page row
  selection and bulk deletion, while templates omit selection controls.
  `/agents/new` configures objective, source context, owner wallet from the
  connected wallet session, budget cap, max paid actions, and allowed paid
  tools in a single vertical four-step flow: goal, tools, funded budget, and
  review. Blank runs start with empty objective/context fields; template links
  prefill those fields from the selected template; marketplace tool links open
  manual mode with that tool selected. Tool access defaults to “AI decides from
  all agent-ready tools,” which resolves the catalog server-side instead of
  sending every tool slug to the browser. Manual mode uses a server-paginated,
  searchable, sortable tool table with the shared current-page master checkbox.
  Manual mode selects one available tool by default when opened and blocks run
  creation unless at least one tool remains selected;
  `/agents/[runId]` funds production runs through the agent budget vault,
  executes the ranked plan, shows planner mode/model, selected and skipped
  tools, planner rationale, budget ledger, receipt links, Markdown-rendered
  deliverables, unused refund controls, and writes Mezo proof attestations.
- `/proofs/[proofId]` publicly displays non-sensitive autonomous run proof
  metadata, proof hash, receipt IDs, budget funding and refund metadata, total
  MUSD spend, attestation transaction, and Mezo explorer link.
- Provider adapters live in `src/features/provider-adapters`; the registry uses
  the generic external HTTP adapter for provider-created listings. The external
  HTTP adapter forwards paid requests to the configured upstream endpoint,
  applies bearer, API-key, query-key, or basic auth server-side, sends
  idempotency headers, removes empty optional request fields from listing
  schema-generated payloads before quoting or forwarding, extracts external job
  IDs, result URLs, public project handoff URLs, and clone URLs through
  configured and conventional JSON paths, and polls provider status endpoints
  for async products. Credit-metered async providers always receive
  `billingMode: "external_prepaid"` plus generic external prepaid metadata with
  order, receipt, buyer, requested billing mode, and settlement references so
  provider APIs can report estimated, charged, and refunded usage without
  importing Tollora settlement logic.
- `/marketplace` lists published provider-created MUSD-paid API products in the
  shared server-fed table with category filters, price badges, provider names,
  execution/result delivery context, agent-ready badges, and entry points for
  run-with-wallet, detail, and autonomous agent runs.
- `/marketplace/[slug]` displays product detail, request schema, response
  schema, copyable reference payload, full endpoint URL, raw 402 inspection
  curl, standalone x402 buyer integration code, execution mode, settlement
  model, result delivery model, Run with wallet entry point, Use from code
  anchor, and Use in agent run entry point.
- `/orders/new` shows selected product price, gateway endpoint, method,
  provider, connected buyer wallet, and a schema-driven request builder that
  generates validated fields from the product request schema, respects explicit
  required/optional markers from imported OpenAPI schemas, coerces arrays,
  objects, numbers, booleans, and URLs before quote requests, and keeps an
  advanced JSON preview before a payable API request is created. Failed
  preparation attempts show a compact readable error plus an expandable complete
  request/response payload so provider quote, validation, and pricing errors are
  visible and copyable during integration testing without cluttering the page.
  Successful preparation clears failure debug state, shows a short success
  status, stores the order in browser session storage, and redirects to the Run
  & Pay order page.
- `/provider` shows the connected wallet's owned provider revenue, API call
  volume, success rate, top product, recent request activity, product listing
  health, production narrative, and tiered provider revenue split.
- `/provider/products` lists provider API products in the shared server-fed
  table for the connected owner wallet with status context, price, call volume,
  gateway path, listing links, bulk deletion for owner-created rows, and
  next-step management actions for drafts, paused listings, and live products.
- `/provider/products/new` uses
  `src/features/marketplace/provider-product-form.tsx` and
  `src/features/marketplace/schemas.ts` to validate provider product metadata,
  schemas, upstream endpoint URL, upstream authentication requirements, async
  polling requirements, runtime model, fixed or credit-metered MUSD pricing,
  wallet fields, agent readiness, OpenAPI-imported operation defaults, and
  visibility before posting to the product API route. Provider form labels link
  to field-specific anchors on `/developers/docs` instead of hover-only help,
  including OpenAPI import, pricing, authentication, runtime, polling, schema,
  webhook, and agent-readiness documentation. The provider form uses the shared
  product input schema for client-side field errors before submission, and the
  API route uses the same schema as the server guard. The OpenAPI importer
  detects operation-level or document-level security schemes, credit fields such
  as `estimatedCredits`, and 202 Accepted job operations, links async
  job-creation operations to matching status endpoints from the imported spec,
  marks required provider auth and polling fields accurately, and preserves
  OpenAPI request-body required/optional field metadata for provider test runs.
- `/provider/products/[productId]` is the provider API management workspace. It
  shows lifecycle controls for publishing, pausing, and returning products to
  draft, a launch checklist, payable schema-driven test runs, gateway endpoint
  copy support, product deletion, provider contract details, and
  request/response schema details.
- `/provider/usage` shows the connected wallet's provider API calls, MUSD
  revenue, buyer wallets, request IDs, agent-run context, and status labels.
- `/orders` uses the shared server-fed table for buyer request search, sorting,
  pagination, status, amount, and order-opening actions. `/orders/[orderId]`
  shows buyer request lifecycle state using shared order status labels and
  descriptions from
  `src/features/marketplace/status.ts`; order detail pages sign x402 MUSD
  payments with the connected browser wallet, check and submit the required Mezo
  MUSD Permit2 allowance transaction when needed, verify MUSD balance before
  asking for payment signatures, wait for the approval receipt and readable
  allowance, retry once when x402 still reports an allowance precondition, retry
  the product call, display step-by-step wallet progress as a compact icon
  timeline with explorer links for submitted transactions, surface settlement
  failure guidance from the x402 facilitator, show payment failures as dedicated
  alert cards with copyable error text, keep long explanations inside
  collapsible details, separate direct API responses from async provider jobs,
  automatically poll provider status when an order has an external job ID or a
  retryable provider outage, keep escrow reserved for retryable provider
  failures such as temporary 5xx, Cloudflare, timeout, rate-limit, or
  provider-marked retryable responses until the 24-hour retry window expires,
  complete async orders when a provider returns a completed status or cloneable
  handoff URL, keep manual polling available, keep 402 inspection as a
  diagnostic action, persist receipt metadata in browser session storage, show
  quote/reservation/final usage amounts for credit-metered calls, claim metered
  deltas through x402 before revealing locked results, show escrow
  reserve/release/refund transaction links when a credit-metered async payment
  uses escrow, and link to the settlement receipt and Mezo explorer transaction.
  Draft products stay hidden from public marketplace usage but can be tested
  through provider management by creating provider-test order records; locally
  persisted draft listings created before owner metadata exists can still be
  tested through matching order records. Browser session order snapshots use
  compact session-safe storage so large provider payloads cannot block the
  visible order state, and provider payload normalization removes malformed
  indexed-character maps while preserving handoff URLs and billing metadata.
- Marketplace products declare whether they are synchronous or asynchronous,
  whether settlement happens after a successful response, after job acceptance,
  or when a completed result is claimed, and whether results are returned
  directly, polled/webhooked, or revealed after completion.
- Marketplace products support fixed per-call MUSD pricing and credit-metered
  pricing. Credit-metered products call a provider quote endpoint or read a
  deterministic credit field before x402 settlement, convert credits to MUSD
  with a configured rate and multiplier, settle the quoted amount before
  expensive provider work starts, route asynchronous metered payments to
  ApiPaymentEscrow when configured, refund escrowed payments when provider work
  fails before a usable result, release escrowed payments only after successful
  completion or result claim, compare final usage against the quote, lock
  results that need a delta payment, include failed quote response status and
  response body in pricing errors, and record quote, paid, actual, escrow, and
  release metadata on orders and receipts.
- `/receipts/[receiptId]` displays product, provider, buyer wallet, provider
  wallet, MUSD amount, fee split, network, transaction hash, and explorer link
  for settled API calls.
- `/billing` displays workspace billing context, managed credit API-key
  creation, MUSD top-up records, API-key debit history, payment readiness,
  autonomous agent spend, proof counts, and recent MUSD receipt records.
- `/admin/products`, `/admin/orders`, `/admin/agents`, `/admin/receipts`,
  `/admin/subscriptions`, and `/admin/operations` provide allowlisted
  operational review for marketplace ownership, paid API request records,
  autonomous agent budgets and statuses, MUSD settlement receipts, on-chain
  subscribers, deployment readiness, contract configuration, and provider
  adapter health. These pages use the shared server-fed table for scalable
  search, sorting, pagination, and scoped bulk actions where lists can grow.
- `/developers` and `/developers/docs` describe provider onboarding, OpenAPI
  import, x402 paid calls, fixed-price provider contracts, credit-metered
  quote-first provider contracts, external prepaid async job metadata, public
  handoff and clone URL result contracts, final usage delta handling, autonomous
  agent runs, Mezo proof attestations, gateway forwarding, receipt records,
  external HTTP adapter behavior, OpenAPI JSON, and the Scalar API reference.
  The developer docs page renders GitHub-flavored Markdown with `react-markdown`
  and `remark-gfm`, uses a sticky table of contents, and exposes stable section
  and field anchors used by provider form documentation links.
- Admin routes use `src/components/layout/admin-sidebar.tsx`; the users table is
  server-rendered from Convex user profiles plus admin allowlist metadata using
  URL search, filter, sort, and pagination parameters. It shows creator
  identity, wallet, email, role, subscription, status, and last seen metadata,
  and supports current-page selection with bulk deletion.
- Admin user row actions use three-dot menus with reusable responsive dialogs
  for editing user details, subscription tier, and destructive confirmations.
- Chain metadata, native currency labels, and explorer URL generation are
  centralized in `src/lib/config/chains.ts`; Mezo Testnet is the default app
  chain with chain ID `31611`, BTC native gas currency,
  `https://rpc.test.mezo.org` RPC, and `https://explorer.test.mezo.org`
  explorer.
- Operational readiness checks live in `src/lib/operations/readiness.ts` and
  feed `/api/health` plus the admin operations page, including agent signer,
  attestor, and public proof readiness.
- x402 network configuration uses the CAIP-2 identifier `eip155:31611`; the
  resource server in `src/lib/x402/tollora-resource-server.ts` registers the EVM
  `exact` scheme, uses `X402_FACILITATOR_URL`, protects product call routes, and
  relies on the x402 stablecoin registry to resolve dollar-denominated prices to
  MUSD on Mezo.
- Walkthrough and deployment documentation lives in `docs/demo-script.md` and
  `docs/deployment-checklist.md`.
- The admin subscriptions page reads SubscriptionManager balance, plan prices,
  paginated subscriber rows, treasury withdrawal support, and explorer links
  from the configured subscription chain.
- Admin access is limited to wallets listed in
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESSES`.
- Global styling via `src/styles/globals.css` and `src/styles/tokens.css`, using
  logo-derived cyan, blue, purple, orange, and yellow brand tokens for light and
  dark themes.
- Wallet provider toggle via `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_PROVIDER` with Thirdweb or
  RainbowKit integrations.
- Environment parsing treats blank optional values as unset so local optional
  URL fields do not fail validation.
- RainbowKit configuration uses the shared Mezo Testnet chain registry when
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is configured, and initializes on Mezo
  Testnet.
- RainbowKit wallet controls live inside the shared header account menu, with
  account details, copy-address, and disconnect actions handled by the
  RainbowKit dialog.
- Wallet configuration helpers in `src/lib/wallet`.
- App route protection uses `src/middleware.ts`,
  `src/lib/auth/wallet-session.ts`, and
  `src/components/layout/protected-app-guard.tsx` to require an active wallet
  connection for `/dashboard`, `/agents`, `/marketplace`, `/orders`,
  `/receipts`, `/provider`, `/profile`, `/billing`, `/settings`, and `/admin`;
  admin routes also require an allowlisted wallet address.
- Wallet-auth redirects add an auth reason to the home page, which displays a
  dismissible notice through `src/components/feedback/auth-required-toast.tsx`.
- `src/components/providers/wallet-session-bridge.tsx` syncs wallet connect and
  disconnect events through `/api/auth`, redirects public-page wallet
  connections to `/dashboard`, and keeps server middleware cookies plus client
  profile hydration aligned with the active wallet.
- Creator identity settings are managed in
  `src/lib/settings/user-settings.ts`, persisted through Convex, and surfaced
  through the header account menu, settings, profile, dashboard, and billing
  components. The editable profile form contains only full name, username, and
  email; subscription tier changes are initiated from pricing and billing
  subscription flows.
- Server-readable admin user records and table controls live in
  `src/lib/admin/admin-users.ts`. Admin role membership is computed only from
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESSES`; user profile records and admin user
  overrides cannot grant admin access.
- Pricing subscription checkout, billing renewal/cancellation controls, user
  payment history links, and admin subscription operations use
  `src/lib/contracts/subscription.ts`,
  `src/lib/contracts/subscription-admin.ts`, the chain registry, and the
  configured `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBSCRIPTION_MANAGER_ADDRESS`.
- Route transitions show a top progress loader via `nextjs-toploader`. Client
  components that navigate programmatically use the `nextjs-toploader/app`
  router wrapper so `push` and `replace` redirects show the same loader as
  link-based navigation. `NavigationProgressEvents` starts the same loader for
  same-origin form submits and browser-level unload navigations so redirects
  outside `next/link` still show progress.
- Theme switching using `next-themes` with class-based dark mode.
