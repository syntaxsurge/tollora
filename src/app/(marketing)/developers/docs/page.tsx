    title: 'How Tollora sells your API',
    body: `
Tollora lets a provider list an existing HTTPS API as a paid marketplace product. Buyers, applications, CLIs, and autonomous agents call the hosted Tollora endpoint. Tollora handles the x402 payment requirement, MUSD settlement on Mezo, provider request forwarding, receipts, and proof metadata.

You do **not** need to clone Tollora or rebuild your API around blockchain code. Your API only needs normal HTTP endpoints that Tollora can call after payment is settled or reserved.

| Role | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Provider API | Owns the real product logic, authentication, quotes, jobs, and results. |
| Tollora gateway | Prices the request, collects x402 payment, calls the provider, stores receipts, and exposes buyer-facing status. |
| Buyer or agent | Calls Tollora, pays through x402 or managed credits, then receives the provider result or a pollable job. |

    group: 'Start here',
    title: 'Recommended publishing flow',
    body: `
1. Open **Provider -> Products -> New**.
2. Import an OpenAPI file or paste each field manually.
3. Choose **fixed** pricing for predictable per-call work, or **credit_metered** pricing for variable-cost work.
4. Add provider authentication so Tollora can call your upstream API server-side.
5. If your API is long-running, map the job ID and status endpoint.
6. Add request/response schemas and a reference payload.
7. Save as **draft** first, test it, then publish it when the marketplace listing is accurate.

Use **draft** until the endpoint, auth, pricing, and schemas are real. Published listings can appear in marketplace pages and agent tool selection.
`
  },
  {
    id: 'agent-brain',
    group: 'Start here',
    title: 'Autonomous agent brain',
    body: `
Tollora agent runs use OpenAI as the planning and synthesis brain when \`AGENT_LLM_API_KEY\` is configured. The model reads the user objective, source context, budget, max paid actions, and allowed marketplace tools, then returns structured JSON with selected tools, skipped tools, request payloads, budget strategy, and synthesis instructions.

The paid execution still belongs to Tollora:

1. OpenAI chooses the tools and payloads.
2. Tollora quotes every selected product.
3. Tollora skips tools that would exceed the run budget.
4. Tollora pays x402/MUSD with the configured agent signer in production mode.
5. Tollora stores receipts, response hashes, and final deliverables.
6. Tollora writes the Mezo proof when the run is attested.

If \`AGENT_LLM_API_KEY\` is missing, the run is labeled as deterministic fallback. Configure \`AGENT_LLM_API_KEY\` for model-planned runs and either leave \`AGENT_LLM_MODEL\` empty for the default \`gpt-5.2\` or set a lower-cost model for development.

    title: 'Import OpenAPI',
    body: `
OpenAPI import is the fastest way to add many provider endpoints. Tollora reads the spec, detects operations, infers auth, builds schemas, picks reference payloads, and suggests async status mappings.

**What your API should expose**

| Item | Why it helps |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAPI JSON or YAML URL | Lets Tollora import operations without manual copy/paste. |
| Security schemes | Lets Tollora mark auth fields as required. |
| Request bodies | Lets Tollora build buyer-facing request examples. |
| Response schemas | Lets Tollora explain what buyers receive. |
| 202 Accepted or job response schemas | Lets Tollora detect async job creation endpoints. |
| Status endpoints with path parameters | Lets Tollora link a job-creation endpoint to a polling endpoint. |

**Good OpenAPI URL:** \`https://provider.example/api/openapi.json\`  
**Avoid:** private localhost URLs, docs pages that return HTML, or OpenAPI specs that omit request and response schemas.

Variable-cost APIs should expose a quote endpoint and a job endpoint:

\`\`\`ts
app.post("/api/quote", async (req, res) => {
  const estimatedCredits = estimateCredits(req.body)
  res.json({
    estimatedCredits,
    billing: {
      unit: "credit",
      estimatedCredits
    }
  })
})

app.post("/api/jobs", async (req, res) => {
  const job = await createJob({
    input: req.body,
    billingMode: req.body.billingMode,
    externalReference: req.body.externalReference
  })

  res.status(202).json({
    jobId: job.id,
    status: "queued",
    estimatedCredits: job.estimatedCredits
  })
})

app.get("/api/jobs/:jobId", async (req, res) => {
  const job = await getJob(req.params.jobId)
  res.json({
    jobId: job.id,
    status: job.status,
    progress: job.progress,
    resultUrl: job.resultUrl,
    result: {
      publicProjectUrl: job.publicProjectUrl,
      cloneUrl: job.cloneUrl
    },
    estimatedCredits: job.estimatedCredits,
    chargedCredits: job.chargedCredits,
    refundedCredits: job.refundedCredits,
    billingStatus: job.billingStatus,
    refundReason: job.refundReason
  })
})
\`\`\`

The provider API should stay generic. It reports credits, job state, and handoff/result URLs. Tollora maps those credits to x402 payments, receipts, refunds, deltas, and proofs. If a provider returns \`review_required\` without a result URL, Tollora keeps the order processing instead of releasing funds. If the provider returns a cloneable handoff URL, Tollora can complete the order and release escrow even when the final render is handled separately.

For temporary provider outages, return a normal error payload with \`retryable: true\`, an HTTP 408/429/5xx status, or a \`retry_after\` value. Tollora keeps escrow reserved, retries the provider call or status check, and refunds only when the 24-hour retry window expires without a valid provider result.
